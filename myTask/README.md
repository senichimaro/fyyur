# TODO Checklist Fyyur

Fully functioning site that is at least capable of doing the following, if not more, using a PostgreSQL database:

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.



## Main Files: Project Structure

1. [ ] `app.py` -- (Missing functionality.) -- **Defines routes and controllers** which handle data and renders views to the user.

2. [x] Models in `app.py` -- (Missing functionality.) -- Defines the data models that set up the database tables.

3. [x] `config.py` -- (Missing functionality.) -- Stores configuration variables and instructions, separate from the main application code. This is where you will need to connect to the database.


## Instructions

1. Connect to database and backend.
2. **TODOS**
    * [x] 1. Connect to a database in `config.py`.
    * [x] 2. Using SQLAlchemy, set up models
    * [x] 3. Implement form submissions for creating new Venues, Artists, and Shows.
    * [x] 4. Implement the controllers for listing venues, artists, and shows.
    * [x] 5. Implement search, powering the `/search` endpoints
    * [x] 6. Serve venue and artist detail pages, powering the `<venue|artist>/<id>` endpoints that power the detail pages.

#### Data Handling with `Flask-WTF` Forms
The starter codes use an interactive form builder library called [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/). This library provides useful functionality, such as form validation and error handling. You can peruse the Show, Venue, and Artist form builders in `forms.py` file. The WTForms are instantiated in the `app.py` file. For example, in the `create_shows()` function, the Show form is instantiated from the command: `form = ShowForm()`. To manage the request from Flask-WTF form, each field from the form has a `data` attribute containing the value from user input. For example, to handle the `venue_id` data from the Venue form, you can use: `show = Show(venue_id=form.venue_id.data)`, instead of using `request.form['venue_id']`.

Acceptance Criteria
-----

1. [x] PostgreSQL database successfully connected.
2. [ ] There should be no use of mock data throughout the app.
3. [ ] The application should behave just as before with mock data, For example:
  * [x] when submits new artist record, be able to see it populate in /artists, as well as search for the artist by name.
  * [x] be able to go `/artist/<artist-id>` to visit a particular artistâ€™s
  * [ ] Venues should continue to be displayed in groups by city and state.
  * [x] Search should be partial string matching and case-insensitive.
  * [ ] Past shows versus Upcoming shows should be distinguished in Venue and Artist pages.
  * [ ] A user should be able to click on the venue for an upcoming show in the Artist's page, and on that Venue's page, see the same show in the Venue Page's upcoming shows section. (assumption: artist creates venues)

4. [x] Define the models in a different file such as `models.py`.
  * [x] The right _type_ of relationship and parent-child dynamics.
  * [x] The relationship between the models should be accurately configured, and referential integrity amongst the models should be preserved.
